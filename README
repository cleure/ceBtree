This is a simple Binary Tree library in C. Support for Red Black Trees is still under development (inserts work, but deletes haven't been implemented yet).

Usage is fairly straightforward:

void my_free_fn(ceBtreeNode *node) {
    free(node->data);
    node->key = NULL;
    node->data = NULL;
}

...

int i;
ceBtree *tree = ceRBtree_Init(ceBtreeIntcmp, my_free_fn);
ceBtreeNode *cur;

for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = i;
    tree->insert(tree, (void *)ptr, (void *)ptr);
}

// Recurse down left side
cur = tree->root;
while (cur) {
    printf("%d\n", *((int *)cur->key));
    cur = cur->left;
}

ceBtree_Free(&tree);

========================================================
TODO
========================================================

- Implement delete for red black tree
    - Macro-tize remove.c, and use that for both bet delete and rbtree delete
- Unit testing framework to verify correctness
- Utility function to verify red black tree
- Rename Btree to BStree, as it's less ambiguous (could be mistaken for B-tree instead of Binary Search Tree).
- Implement iterative in-order and pre-order traversal
